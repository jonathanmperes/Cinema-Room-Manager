# Cinema-Room-Manager
Cinema Room Manager - JetBrains Kotlin Course.
This project is a part of the following tracks:
Kotlin Basics, Kotlin Developer, First Glance at Android.
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: 
a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. 
The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. 
In this project, you have an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: 
sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.
